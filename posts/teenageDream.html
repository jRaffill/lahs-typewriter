	Everything I’ve ever wanted fits
	under one sparkly sunroof.

Sixth-grade years old,
	dreaming of blue dresses draped in silk 
	homecoming high heels digging against our feet
	boyfriends waving PROM? posters outside our windows,
	tying rose petal corsages around our wrists

	and before the night trickles down,
	my friend would’ve arrived —
	protected by her roofless pink car, 
	shiny license in hand, her own golden trophy. 

Sixth-grade believes we took that car 
on a road trip to SoCal
	because SoCal is only a weekend away
	A teenage neverland,
	where we can soar through calm roads, 
	suburban roses 
	and ivory buildings,
breathing in the scent of gold from the peachy sun.

By midnight 
Sixth-grade has met her coronation,
becoming a starlet
watching diamonds crawl across the sky, singing
	<em>it’s a week from your birthday, 
	Happy, happy birthday,
	Sweet sixteen, my love </em>
a star’s melody. 
Sixth-grade smiles,
	because sixteen means bubbly pink balloons and mousse cake
	sixteen will be licenses and movie nights,
	polaroids by the window screens

sixteen means BFF spelled on matching candy bracelets,
sixteen means a cure – a remedy to death, 
	an eternal heartbeat,
	car radio songs screaming louder than summer –

<div style="text-align:right"> [Guitar intro]
<em>	you think I’m pretty without any makeup on
	you think I’m funny
	when I tell the punchline wrong
	I know you get me,
	so I let the walls fall down… </em> </div>

When homecoming ends with rain,
he’ll plant a special kiss on Sixth-grade lips
her sapphire blue dress 
gripped between his fingers,
but Katy Perry still lingers for longer –

<div style="text-align:right"> <em>We can dance / until we die
you and I
will be young forever</em> </div>
