		"contentPreview": "	I first learned to make fruit tea as a middle school student. My mother had just bought this grand contraption of a device—an “electric tea kettle,” apparently. It was innovative, all glass and stainless steel, with smoothed edges and round corners. My first sip of brewed grapefruit tea is carved into my brain vividly: a faint touch of bitterness incorporated into sweet splashes of citrus flavor."
