<p><em>Good morning, Blaine,</em> the voice in his head said as he jolted awake. <em>It is 3:30 AM. Your shift begins in 30 minutes.</em></p>
<p>Blaine struggled to open his eyes. 3:30 already? It seemed like he had just gone to sleep. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that a good four hours of sleep had passed by just like that. But that&rsquo;s how it always was.</p>
<p>He reached over to his bedside table, barely able to see from the dim artificial light streaming in from the singular cloudy window, grabbing his Universal Tech WakeUp&reg; pills, downing them quickly with the glass of water he had placed on the table last night. It worked better that way, he had learned. Trying to get a glass of water from the faucet on the other side of his efficiency apartment was too tall a task in the morning. Besides, rates for water were higher in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Bring up the news</strong>, Blaine thought as he took his ZeroCorp nutrient pills. A delightful breakfast. Certainly cheaper than physical food. 2000 Trigons for a small American breakfast? Surely it wasn&rsquo;t that good. Admittedly, he had never eaten &ldquo;real&rdquo; food, but he imagined it couldn&rsquo;t be worth it. A day&rsquo;s worth of that stuff and he would be nearly broke.</p>
<p><em>Are you feeling down? Could your life use some more... vigor?</em> The voice in his head asked. <em>Try ZeroCorp Envigor&reg;! Now releases 15% more dopamine! Buy your first pack for only 299.99 Trigons!</em></p>
<p>Blaine thought for a second. It was a tempting offer. He could buy some... he wanted to buy the Envigor&reg;. It would make him feel good. He would <strong>buy</strong>&mdash;no. Blaine sighed. He had almost bought it. He had almost spent a week&rsquo;s worth of salary. For something that would only last, what, a few hours?</p>
<p><em>Now, your daily news,</em> The voice in Blaine&rsquo;s head continued cheerfully.<em> This morning, a terrorist attack struck a Sun Dynamics plant, aiming to disrupt vital work. Fortunately, Protectorate security forces quickly stopped the subversives and liquidated them. In unrelated news&mdash;</em></p>
<p>Sun Dynamics. That was where Blaine worked. Who would want to stop their work? It was <em>vital</em> to the economy. Without it, The Protectorate <em>would collapse</em>. Besides, it was good work, was it not? <em>Yes</em> it was. Blaine <em>knew</em> he <em>liked</em> his job. It was the <em>best</em> job in the entire world. Well, at least he could be doing worse. He was, after all, in a better place than the median citizen. He actually had some of his own money. And he only owed a few thousand Trigons of debt to Sun Dynamics. After all, they had modified him so that he could work for them. And he owed them for that. It was <em>only fair.</em></p>
<p>Blaine exited his apartment, number 6509E, and into the tight corridors of Residency Building 509.</p>
<p>The news in his head continued on. <em>At the Protectorate Primacy Convocation yesterday, Director Eden Tovar praised the great innovations of some of The Protectorate&rsquo;s leading corporations, including Sun Dynamics and ZeroCorp, and lauded their contributions to the ever-growing economy, which he noted has reached record levels of growth this year. &ldquo;Thanks to the great work of these corporations, citizens of The Protectorate are able to enjoy unparalleled levels of wealth never seen before in human history,&rdquo; he declared.</em></p>
<p>Blaine entered the Flash Train, which was getting ready to leave. His news feed was temporarily interrupted. <em>Destination?</em> <strong>Sun Dynamics Operating Plant 82,</strong> he thought. <em>The train leaves in 5 minutes. Estimated ride time: 7 minutes. Today&rsquo;s rate is: 1 Trigon per minute.</em> His news feed came back up, and he continued listening as he waited for the Flash Train to depart.</p>
<p><em>Departing now. Thank you for choosing Triasonic Transportation.</em> The train plunged out into the black sky, darkened by the early morning light and the heavy industrial fog. <em>Is the air in your apartment smoggy? Do you have a cough? Fear not! RKL Group has you covered with its real Pure Air. Manufactured just like Earth&rsquo;s ancient atmosphere. Buy one for your RKL Group apartment today, for only 29 Trigons.</em> Damn, realized Blaine. I forgot to buy one of those last week. I only have one left. Only three day&rsquo;s worth of clean air left. <strong>I&rsquo;ll buy two canisters for 58 Trigons.</strong><em> Transaction completed. RKL Group is pleased to conduct business with you.</em></p>
<p><em>Yesterday night&rsquo;s Cyber Ball game between the Protectors and the Saboteurs concluded in a tie, which will be settled in a final tie-breaker game this evening. While coach Zed of the Protectors acknowledges his team faces an upward fight, he says he&rsquo;s confident that they will prevail. &ldquo;After all, we did end up tying them. They thought we would lose. So, I think we got a good chance going into the final.&rdquo;, he said. That concludes your daily news briefing. Stability and Prosperity to The Protectorate!</em></p>
<p>The Flash Train stopped. <em>Destination reached: Sun Dynamics Operating Plant 82.</em> Blaine got up and left the train.<em> Your fare is 7 Trigons. Thank you for choosing Tirasonic Transportation.</em></p>
<p>Blaine entered Sun Dynamics Operating Plant 82. <strong>Check in for work.</strong> <em>Good morning, employee Blaine. Your shift begins in 6 minutes.</em> He walked across the vast floor of the factory and into his work enclosure.</p>
<p>Standing in his enclosure, Blaine busied himself attaching the nodes into his body, a process he had gotten quite quick at after many times. Before he knew it, his shift had begun.</p>
<p>The nodes energized and Blaine felt the force of a thousand stars coursing through his body for a brief second. Then the direction reversed. He felt his energy being extracted from himself. His muscles, bones, and tissues submitted to the draining force of the nodes. His life bled out of himself. His vision blurred and he began feeling lightheaded. Then everything went dark. Just as usual.</p>
<p>The nightmares set in. As he lay there, motionless, his body enslaved to the factory, Blaine&rsquo;s mind was dragged along the paths of horror. The pain of the entire world pierced him through the darkness. His mind screamed out for help, but there was no help, no escape, from the dreaded visions of the void. The purgatory of the tortures burned deep into his psyche. He wanted it to stop. The agony would not cease. Like a trapped animal, he bit off millions of his own legs, tearing and rending muscle and bone, in a desperate attempt to escape. There was no fleeing. He ran through the endless labyrinth, pursued by his doom. All he ran into were dead ends. The walls were closing into him. The prison of his existence rapidly shrunk, confining him. He tried to leave the shrinking door, escape the crushing of himself in the now miniscule room. He could no longer fit through the door. The room collapsed in on him, squeezing him into a singularity. He felt the fire of eternity burning into his bones. He tried to end it all, stop the torment forever. But reincarnation would always reach him and pull him back into his personal hell. There was no escaping. The pain, the agony, the torture would not stop. It would never stop. There was no escaping. No stopping. No end. Just suffering. For eternity. Eternity. Forever&hellip;</p>
<p>Blaine&rsquo;s consciousness floated back into reality, a plastic bag lazily floating down to the ground of the real world. His vision returned, blurry at first, and then focusing again to the blank panel of metal in front of him. He remembered nothing. The horrors beyond the darkness of vision did not follow him. He was exhausted. His limbs felt as if they were dissolving. Blaine could feel his depleted cells across his body on the verge of giving up. He wanted to lie down and take a four decade rest.</p>
<p><em>It is now 8 PM. Your shift is over. You have received your daily wage of 50 Trigons. Thank you for working at Sun Dynamics.</em></p>
<p>Blaine took out the nodes and shakily staggered out of his work enclosure and collapsed into a seat in the waiting Flash Train. <em>Destination?</em> <strong>Residency Building 509,</strong> Blaine forced himself to think. <em>The train leaves in 5 minutes. Estimated ride time: 7 minutes. Today&rsquo;s rate is: 1 Trigon per minute.</em></p>
<p>Blaine relinquished control of his worn out body and slumped down in his seat, waiting until he barely heard the voice in his head say, <em>Departing now. Thank you for choosing Triasonic Transportation.</em> As the train plunged out into the dirt-black sky, he heard a familiar advertisement. <em>Are you feeling down? Could your life use some more... vigor? Try ZeroCorp Envigor&reg;! Now releases 15% more dopamine! Buy your first pack for only 299.99 Trigons!</em> He was too tired to even think up the order.</p>
<p>Soon enough, though it felt like hours later, the train pulled into Residency Building 509. <em>Destination reached: Residency Building 509.</em> <em>Your fare is 7 Trigons. Thank you for choosing Tirasonic Transportation.</em> Blaine stumbled out of the train and into his apartment.</p>
<p>First things first, he injected himself with one dose of Revitalize&reg;, which Sun Dynamics <em>generously</em> provided him with for a <em>low and reasonable</em> price of 8 Trigons per dose. He lay down in his bed as he let the drug rebuild his sapped organs.</p>
<p>His eyes drifted around his empty apartment. He was isolated in the dark room, just scarcely lit by the constant industrial lighting outside. He wished he could afford lighting. It would make him feel less abandoned. The empty room seemed to stretch for miles around him. He wondered what it would be like if there were someone else in the room&mdash;a real person, not just a MetaNet avatar. If he didn&rsquo;t have that job&mdash;<em>no. He liked his job. He wouldn&rsquo;t give it up for anything. No. His job was good.</em></p>
<p>Blaine sighed and got up, grabbing his dinner&mdash;some more ZeroCorp nutrient pills&mdash;and downed them with a 1.50 Trigon glass of water. He filled up another glass and set it on his bedside table for the next morning. His night&rsquo;s tasks done, he slumped back in bed and stared blankly at the ceiling for a few fleeting moments.</p>
<p><strong>Open MetaNet,</strong> he thought. <em>Welcome back to the MetaNet, Blaine. With Universal Tech, anything is possible. Today&rsquo;s session will cost 2 Trigons per hour.</em> In front of his eyes flashed the limitless virtual universe. He ventured out into it, not knowing what he was searching for. Happiness? No, he had given up on that elusive ideal a long time ago. A short laugh? Maybe he could find a few videos that would elicit a short chuckle. If only he could remember what they were about a few minutes later. Some fascinating piece of information? Well, the MetaNet was the wrong place to look for that. He turned his mind off and let the virtual screen suck him in. Everything blended into the same homogenous MetaNet soup that he was so used to. For hours, Blaine swam through the endless sea of content, in search of the ephemeral euphoria that always promised to be around the next corner. But when he got there, all he found was nothingness, an infinite chasm of superficialness.</p>
<p>It was nearly eleven PM. Blaine felt himself glued to the MetaNet, even in knowing its futility. He told himself he didn&rsquo;t want to continue, that he just wanted to go to sleep, that he would really feel better if he stopped, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He struggled to pry himself away from the virtual world. It beckoned to him, enticed him back with the cloying promise of bliss. Just one more view and you&rsquo;ll be done. Just one more view... He tried to rip his eyes from the alluring digital reality, but he could not. His eyes were welded to the apparitions flashing before him. His mind was powerless to act, dragged along by the mirage in his head. Blaine submitted to his virtual overlord, knowing that fatigue would eventually set in. It always did eventually, rescuing him from the abyss of MetaNet.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t remember exactly when it reached him, probably around midnight, but he eventually fell asleep. But his rest did not last long. <em>Good morning, Blaine,</em> the voice in his head said as he jolted awake.<em> It is 3:30 AM. Your shift begins in 30 minutes.</em></p>
<p>Blaine struggled to open his eyes. 3:30 already? It seemed like he had just gone to sleep. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that a good four hours of sleep had passed by just like that.</p>
<p>He reached over to his bedside table, barely illuminated by the dim artificial light streaming in from the cloudy window, grabbing his Universal Tech WakeUp&reg; pills, downing them quickly with the glass of water he had placed on the table last night. It worked better that way, he had learned.</p>
<p><strong>Bring up the news,</strong> Blaine thought as he took his ZeroCorp nutrient pills. They made a delightful breakfast, and were certainly cheaper than physical food. Admittedly, he had never eaten &ldquo;real&rdquo; food, but surely it couldn&rsquo;t be worth the cost.</p>
<p><em>Are you feeling down? Could your life use some more... vigor?</em> The voice in his head asked. <em>Try ZeroCorp Envigor&reg;! Now releases 15% more dopamine! Buy your first pack for only 299.99 Trigons!</em></p>
<p>The offer tempted Blaine. His life was certainly a bit gloomy. It could use some more vigor. He could buy the Envigor&reg;. He wanted to. He would&mdash;no. It cost almost a week&rsquo;s salary. He would never&mdash;Do it. Buy it, he thought. You haven&rsquo;t felt good in longer than you can remember. Envigor&reg; will solve your problems. Give you that blast of happiness that has long eluded you. No. He couldn&rsquo;t do it. His life savings would only last for maybe a few week&rsquo;s worth of the stuff. Then what? Besides, the MetaNet was already his drug of choice. And cheaper. But maybe he would try the Envigor&reg; one day. What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p><em>Now, your daily news. Amazing news from the sports front! In last night&rsquo;s tie-breaking Cyber Ball game between the Protectors and the Saboteurs, the Protectors unexpectedly triumphed in a closely contested game. Coach Zed of the team said that he was proud of his team and knew they would pull it through: &ldquo;We won. We are winning. I mean, I think that our team is amazing. Just look at that play...</em></p>
<p>Blaine tuned out. He wasn&rsquo;t listening to the news. It became a background noise that his brain ignored, just like the constant sound of the machines outside in the concrete megalopolis. He went through his daily routine. He exited his apartment, entered the Flash Train, confirmed his destination, and watched the bleak city zip past his eyes without seeing anything. He was an automaton, propelled onwards by who knows what. Perhaps it was money. The money he needed to survive, so that he could work another day, and earn the money back again. The forlorn hope of a better life he knew he would always be an arm&rsquo;s length away from attaining. He didn&rsquo;t even know why he continued. He never gave the matter thought. It just seemed natural&mdash;what alternative did he have? He let his mind slip into the oblivion of routine. <em>He had no complaints. He could go on like this for the rest of his life. He would go on like this for the rest of his life. After all, what was the alternative?</em> Blaine didn&rsquo;t need that question answered.</p>
<p>The Flash Train stopped. <em>Destination reached: Sun Dynamics Operating Plant 82.</em> Blaine got up and left the train.<em> Your fare is 7 Trigons. Thank you for choosing Tirasonic Transportation.</em></p>
<p>Blaine left the train and entered Sun Dynamics Operating Plant 82. <strong>Check in for work.</strong> <em>Good morning, employee Blaine. Your shift begins in 6 minutes.</em> He walked through the blinding lights illuminating the vast bleach-white floor of the factory and into his work enclosure.</p>
<p>In his enclosure again, Blaine started attaching the nodes into his body, preparing himself for whatever tortures he knew were likely to come, although he never remembered them. Before he knew it, his shift had begun.</p>
<p>The nodes energized and Blaine felt the power of a thousand stars coursing through his body for a brief second. Then the sucking began. He felt his energy being drained from himself. His muscles, bones, and tissues submitted to the draining force of the nodes. His life, his spirit, bled out of himself and into the factory. His vision blurred and he began feeling lightheaded. Then everything went dark.</p>
<p>The nightmares began. Blaine felt the eternal cruelty and malice of humans digging into him. He felt the uncaring callousness of the universe to him, to humanity, and all that would ever be achieved. He felt&mdash;</p>
<p>Everything suddenly cut off. Blaine felt himself falling. He was careening through a tunnel of light towards an unknown destination. What was happening? Where was the darkness? It had seemed to have disappeared, gone. He felt the disorientation of the caveman transported to the modern Earth. But he felt strangely good. As if the burden of an entire planet had been lifted off his body. As if he could breathe freely again. The tunnel opened up. Blaine hardly had time to see the edge of his work enclosure before he hit his head on it. Darkness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine heard a voice. It must be my brain chip, he thought. That was one hell of a dream. My normal working routine, but then going all wrong. It was intense though. He reached for his bedside table. It wasn&rsquo;t there. Blaine&rsquo;s eyes flew open. Standing above him was another human. Talking. Talking to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! We don&rsquo;t have much time to get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine squinted at the person. He barely could make her out in the darkness of the factory. Wait. Darkness? The factory was always lit. Why wasn&rsquo;t it lit? What was he doing on the ground? Before his shift was over? What was that weird cutting off of the normal work routine he had felt? Why could he remember his work now? Why was someone talking to him? What was going on?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-What&mdash;&rdquo; Blaine realized that he was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time for explanations right now. Quick, grab my hand and let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine hesitated. Get out? Leave behind his work? That would mean leaving behind his life. Sun Dynamics would never stop to get him, make him pay. Did he really want to abandon, destroy the life he had spent decades building?</p>
<p>Blaine reached out his hand. Then retracted it to his head. A searing pain was coursing through his brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that. It always feels like that when your chip is destroyed. It&rsquo;ll get better soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th-Thanks, I guess.&rdquo; Blaine said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand again, and the mysterious woman standing above him pulled him up. He could now get a good look at his surroundings. The factory was in ruins, with bits of twisted concrete and metal lying strewn across the once pristine floor. He saw, across the room, a gaping hole where once there had been wall. There were many people standing across the floor, wearing slightly dilapidated uniforms. The same one the woman in front of him was wearing. They were helping up other employees from their work enclosures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will get in so much trouble for this,&rdquo; he remarked, almost to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel like coming with us, you don&rsquo;t have to. But I would recommend that you do. Sun Dynamics doesn&rsquo;t look kindly upon even their employees who don&rsquo;t join the resistance, but were still present for one of our attacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were too many thoughts flying through Blaine&rsquo;s head. He didn&rsquo;t know what to think. It was a strange sensation, thinking for himself. He was all too accustomed to his chip arresting any overly deviant thoughts, which he certainly had a lot of right now. Blaine thought back to the exhilarating feeling of freedom he had felt a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No, I wasn&rsquo;t saying that. I&mdash;I would like to join you. You&rsquo;re the&mdash;uh&mdash;terrorists that they&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been talking about, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we prefer the term freedom fighters,&rdquo; she smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Selene. Welcome to the resistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selene reached out her hand, which, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation to realize what the gesture meant, Blaine shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;ll be wanting this soon,&rdquo; Selene said, handing Blaine a crude air filtration mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have everyone who&rsquo;s willing to join or come with us?&rdquo; she shouted out towards the other members of the resistance.</p>
<p>There were affirmative responses from the fighters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small group quickly scrambled out of the hole in the factory wall, and onto the roof of the neighboring building. Blaine and several of his colleagues, of whom he had never met before, cautiously followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry up! You don&rsquo;t want to be here when the security forces show up!&rdquo; Selene called out towards the newly liberated workers.</p>
<p>They ran across the cluttered rooftops, the sooty air clinging to their clothes, trying to hold them back. Blaine was grateful for the air filtration mask he had received. Before long, they reached the edge of the building complex. A precipitous drop faced them. The rebels had placed a rickety ladder over the edge. Several of them quickly climbed down. Selene and several other fighters stayed behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to climb down this ladder now. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve secured it. Just don&rsquo;t let the heights worry you, we have to go down here quickly if we want to escape safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine stared down into the abyss just in front of his feet. The sinister darkness beckoned to him. He could feel himself falling down into it. He shuddered. He wasn&rsquo;t ready for this. Not just a terrifying descent. A life outside of the confines of the society that The Protectorate had built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there another way?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t. This is the best way towards the Sun Dynamics plant, and to try to go another route would take too long. Security forces would get us.&rdquo; Selene replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely there must be another way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Either you go this way, or you go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine stared resignedly into the perpetual smog that hung over the city. He wanted freedom&mdash;he was sure of that. But a part of his brain was holding him back. Just think of the dangers. The uncertainties. What he was about to do would take him far away from the life he had known for his entire existence. But that life certainly wasn&rsquo;t good. But then again, this new life represented a complete unknown. Who knew what he would face out there? Was it worth abandoning a life that, while having its difficulties, was survivable?</p>
<p>His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a loud bang. He whirled around, and saw smoke rising from near the ladder. The body parts of one of his former colleagues were scattered across the roof. There were shouts of alarm from the rebels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The security forces are here! Quick! Get down the ladder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine looked up at the sky and saw the Protectorate enforcer drone hovering in the air, just having fired off an explosive round. It was strange. He recalled seeing those drones in the news several times before, liquidating some radicals or other such subversive group. He never thought he&rsquo;d come face to face with one. He stared, almost hypnotized, as the drone fired off another explosive round towards the rebels. Time slowed as the fighters dived out of the way, some too late. The drone was lit up as they fired back with their rudimentary machine guns, bullets bouncing off the armor of the drone, hitting its rotors.</p>
<p>Blaine felt himself gripped by a strange energy. Noticing a dilapidated piece of hardware languishing on the roof next to him, he picked it up and hurled it at the drone with all the strength he could muster. There was no turning back now. He had broken all his ties with The Protectorate, with his old life.</p>
<p>He watched as the drone was knocked off balance, with more small arms fire from Selene&rsquo;s revolutionaries finishing the drone off. It fell to the ground with a thump.</p>
<p>He heard Selene yelling towards him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing? You&rsquo;ve got to get out of here now! There are more drones coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine looked into the distance, seeing a column of drones rapidly approaching their location. He looked over at Selene. Then at the ladder, which many of his colleagues were still struggling to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a gun?&rdquo; he found himself asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re not experienced in this! You&rsquo;ve got to save yourself now! We&rsquo;ll deal with the security forces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I need is a spare gun. Do you have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selene gave Blaine an exasperated look and handed him a spare gun from her backpack and turned her sights back to the incoming drones. Blaine glanced over at her, looking at how she was holding her gun. He watched her fire it. So that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re used, he thought.</p>
<p>He brought up his own gun, aiming at the nearest drone, and pulled the trigger. The recoil was more than he was expecting. He felt his arm being jerked back with a superhuman force, the lead stream surging out the front of the gun, and rushing towards the drone. It was intoxicating, the power streaming out of his weapon. The drone, under the crushing weight of the combined fire of the revolutionaries, came crashing down to the ground.</p>
<p>As bullets from the drones whizzed by him, and he fired back as best he could, he once again felt that exhilarating feeling he had felt for a moment when he was freed from the factory. Even amidst the carnage around him, explosives going off, revolutionaries and freed employees being cut down, Blaine felt a freedom he had never felt before in his entire existence. This is the life, he thought.</p>
<p>There was a deafening explosion, and the world lit up before him. The battle around him faded into the background as Blaine felt himself falling. The next thing he knew, he was staring up at the sky as Selene stood worryingly next to him. He felt a distinct numbness in his legs. He struggled to sit up, looking down at his legs. They were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo; he half-heard himself saying. The world was starting to darken around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you not to stay here and fight!&rdquo; Selene said.</p>
<p>Several thoughts flashed through Blaine&rsquo;s mind. He wanted to tell Selene about himself, who he was, what his name was, what he liked, what he disliked. He wanted to tell her how great he had just felt fighting, how liberating it felt to escape from the life that was holding him in chains. He wanted to ask her about herself, what her life was like. He wanted to ask her what she thought of him. If they could maybe have a future life together.</p>
<p>Instead, he just slightly nodded at her. And so the life of Blaine Clarke came to an end.</p>
