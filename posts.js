The golden late-afternoon light flooded the deck, spilling onto the wind-grazed balcony. Past that warm glow that bathed the floor, in the dim interior of the ship barely touched by the waning light of the day, the captain sat regarding the timeworn papers spread out on his desk. The four manuscripts which were the key to the airship’s long travels he had masterminded."

Your shift begins in 30 minutes. </em> Blaine struggled to open his eyes. 3:30 already? It seemed like he had just gone to sleep. He couldn’t believe that a good four hours of sleep had passed by just like that. But that’s how it always was."

		"contentPreview": "	I first learned to make fruit tea as a middle school student. My mother had just bought this grand contraption of a device—an “electric tea kettle,” apparently. It was innovative, all glass and stainless steel, with smoothed edges and round corners. My first sip of brewed grapefruit tea is carved into my brain vividly: a faint touch of bitterness incorporated into sweet splashes of citrus flavor."

I’ve been watching the currents within it for the past few minutes and I’m entranced. Beneath the thick veil of white flakes my eyes trace the shape of a museum, and the silver calligraphy beneath that spells out, “MET.”"
