<p>“What?” I exclaimed to myself.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be. I read the email again, and then for a third, fourth, time. It did not change what I was seeing.</p>
<p>“Lora Sanders will no longer be working with you. She has been suspended from the company. If you see her, do not hesitate in calling the police.” It read. The perplexing email was said to have come from the Internal Department of Supervision, with an official-looking seal located below the terse message.</p>
<p>It didn’t make any sense. Lora Sanders had been a diligent and productive coworker, and wasn’t just working along with me on my project, but with several other employees. Why “suspend” her? She had put in good work, and had shown no signs of stopping before her abrupt absence yesterday. And besides, why demand calling the police on the sight of her? Surely that was grossly excessive. What kind of person would need the police to be immediately called on them? Certainly not Lora. There was no doubt in my mind that she wasn’t any type of bad person like that. For all the time I had worked with her at Global Market Solutions, she had always struck me as a bright and well-meaning person. The latter quality, granted, was shocking in the advertising business, but she had never let it affect her work.</p>
<p>Moreover, what was this so-called “Internal Department of Supervision”? I was by no means a scholar of the company’s byzantine hierarchy, but I had never heard of it before. And if it had the authority to unilaterally dismiss a good employee, under the threat of police force, I should’ve heard it mentioned at least once in passing. I racked my brains to see if I had just forgotten it—I wouldn’t put it past myself, especially with it having a name like that—but my search came up clear. Even so, I wasn’t especially inclined to believe the email was a hoax. After all, Lora had been absent from work for two days in a row. That seldom occurred, and when it did, she always let all of her coworkers know. I had received no such communication from her. In fact, I had sent her an email of my own yesterday, but had received no reply. Just radio silence.</p>
<p>I stared at my computer screen, dumbfounded. As I had said, the situation made no sense, even for the advertising industry. Why had this happened to her? And who had meted out this fate to her? I was not a stranger to arbitrary and esoteric orders being handed down to me from Management, but this was going far, even for them. If the mysterious email had even come from them in the first place.</p>
<p>I glanced back at the email. And then I noticed: it had not been sent to just me, but also to several other employees, presumably the other people she had been collaborating with. Maybe they would know something. I pulled up the employee database and entered the names of the other recipients of the email. There! I had found one that even worked in the same department as me. Terence Carter. I could probably talk to him. Although first, I might just try replying to the email itself.</p>
<p>I wrote a short reply back to the “Internal Department of Supervision”, asking exactly who they were, and why they had decreed Lora “suspended”, and ordered us to call the police against her if we happened to chance upon her. I sent it off, and awaited a reply. In the meantime, I went back to work on the advertisement script for the Randall Brothers, Inc. Automatic Sheet Folder that Lora and I had just started working on.</p>
<p>At the present moment, I was trying to think of a good word that would rhyme with “sheet”. Neat? That could work, but Randall Brothers, Inc. would probably want their product to be described as more than “neat”. More like—life changing. Of course, it wasn’t, but this is advertising we are talking about. Anyway, life changing didn’t rhyme with sheet. What about... meat? No, that was just weird. How could I even mention any type of food in a commercial about an automatic sheet folder? Sure, advertisements of that type had been done before, but I was nowhere near on par with any of the Greats of the advertising industry. I tried to think of some more rhymes. Elite? Well, it wasn’t supposed to be a luxury product. If it were, I could’ve used that word to justify selling the product at exorbitant prices to rich people who had more money than they would ever need. But the sheet folder was supposed to be aimed at everyday consumers. What about bittersweet? No. Definitely not. Implying that anything at all was wrong with a product was completely off-limits in the advertising business.</p>
<p>Maybe the jingle idea wasn’t that great after all. At least not without Lora. She definitely was much better at things like rhymes than I was. I sighed. I missed her amiable presence. It had always masked the drudgery of coming up with new ways to sell useless products to unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p>After some more time spent staring at the script, trying to tweak various things, I looked back at my computer. Surely I would’ve received a reply by now. And I had. But it wasn’t the type of reply I had been looking for at all.</p>
<p>“Employee Kline: We are not soliciting inquiries,” it read. “With regards to former employee Sanders, you are to report her to the police if you ever encounter or see her on or near the premises. This is a matter of paramount security.” The email was signed, again, by the Internal Department of Supervision, along with its seal.</p>
<p>Of course, they hadn’t answered any of my questions, and had just left me with more. A matter of paramount security? How could keeping someone like Lora away from the company be critical to its security? What was up with their non-response? Surely there wouldn’t be any problem with at least providing some detail on who they actually were. Well, if I wouldn’t get anything useful from them, at least I could probably learn something from that Terence Carter I had just looked up earlier.</p>
<p>I turned off my computer and exited my office. His was just a few minutes away from mine. I would just go over there, ask him if he could enlighten me about the mistifying situation, and go right back to my office to resume my work.</p>
<p>I entered his office, expectant that I would get this mystery at least partially cleared up.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Terence Carter? Could I talk to you for a moment?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure. After all, I’m a bit busy with this latest Alphatec campaign.” he replied.</p>
<p>“Oh, tell me about it,” I laughed. Alphatec was a notorious client of our company—it always had us make advertisements for some very bizarre products. And in advertising, that’s a very difficult achievement. Furthermore, it always was very exacting about the advertising we made for it. Nine times out of ten, even if you followed all the capricious standards it gave you, it would find some reason to reject your ad and make you do it over again.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what’d you want to talk to me about?”</p>
<p>“Well, I had been working with Lora Sanders, as I assume you must’ve been as well, when I got this strange email, along with you, saying that she was suspended from the company and that we should call the police should we see her. Do you happen to know anything about that?” I asked.</p>
<p>His face suddenly hardened.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“The... email? I mean, I checked, and you got it too. Have you not read it yet?”</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
<p>I was somewhat taken aback by this abrupt blunt dismissal.</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything that might’ve happened with Lora or anything...?”</p>
<p>Terence Carter got up from his desk and physically pushed me out of his office.</p>
<p>“Don’t come back here again. Especially not if you’re going to ask stupid questions like that.” he said before slamming the door in my face.</p>
<p>I stared at the door for a good half-minute, stunned. I mean, some people in the advertising business can be huge jerks, but this was something else. He completely changed his behavior once I had asked him about Lora. But why? I felt that this short trip had left me with more questions than when I started.</p>
<p>I walked back to my office, pondering my next course of action. None of the other people listed on the email along with me were from the same department, so it would be hard to be able to get to them. Besides, after that interaction with Terence Carter, I decided that I probably didn’t even want to talk to them. But what else could I do? I thought for a second. Maybe I could try to find out something about the Internal Department of Supervision myself, not go through any intermediaries. Maybe I could look it up in the company hierarchy.</p>
<p>I was about to enter my office when I saw one of my colleagues, Leo Winters, exit his office for his customary late lunch break. A thought came over me.</p>
<p>“Hey, Leo, could I use your office for a second while you’re away?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, sure, if you want,” he replied somewhat confusedly. “Just don’t mess with any of my stuff, of course.”</p>
<p>I thanked him and entered his office, opening up his computer. I opened the company hierarchy information flowchart and navigated through its byzantine interface, looking for the so-called Internal Department of Supervision. I tried sorting through the departments, selecting random employees and going upwards in the hierarchy, and searching top down from the CEO to the lowest employee, but to no avail. I could not find the elusive department. But that couldn’t be. I was sure there was something with authority taking the actions of the Internal Department of Supervision—Lora wouldn’t just go completely AWOL just like that, and mentioning her alleged dismissal wouldn’t completely change the mood of a fellow employee, if there wasn’t some force behind it. Something was going on.</p>
<p>I then remembered the executive authorization code I had. I had gotten it some time ago from a high up executive for doing a favor for him. Now, him giving me unofficial access to executive authorization privileges wasn’t exactly conforming to company policy—far from it—but the favor I had done him wasn’t following company policy either. But those rule violations were really irrelevant, as he had power, and was satisfied with the deal. But I was glad I had the code now.</p>
<p>I restarted the computer and entered the code into the computer. I brought up the company hierarchy information flowchart again, and sure enough, I found the Internal Department of Supervision in no time at all. I opened up the information on it, and found its location within the company headquarters. Building E, floor 7. Interesting. Last I had heard, that floor was still under construction. I was about to check the department powers and function section when, suddenly, the computer screen went dark. I hadn’t touched anything. I frantically tried to restart it, turn it back on again. The screen stubbornly remained pitch black.</p>
<p>A feeling of dread came over me and I quickly exited Leo’s office, making sure nobody saw me. Back from my office, I watched over Leo’s office. For a while, nothing happened. But then, I saw a shadowy figure enter the office. It didn’t look like anybody in the department. I glanced down at the advertising script on my desk, trying to look like I was working. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw the man in Leo’s office take out a walkie-talkie. A few other shadowy figures quickly moved across the corridor between Leo’s office and mine, and split up in various directions. I stared furiously at my work. And then Leo Winters came up the corridor, right up to his office. Before he made it in, he was stopped by the man who had stayed inside his office. The man brought up his walkie-talkie again, and the other people returned along the corridor. Leo Winters was looking very confused, and was clearly trying to ask the mysterious men what was going on, but I could see him receiving no answer. Instead, two of the men grabbed him by the shoulders and took him away. The others started clearing out his office. I decided it was a good day to go home early.</p>
<p>Back at home, I could not take my mind off of the day’s events. Lora’s puzzling absence and the even more mystifying email. The bizarre standoffishness of Terence Carter regarding the subject. The apparent non-existence of the Internal Department of Supervision, and the disconcerting shutting off of the computer once I had found details on it. And, of course, the secret-police style apprehension of Leo Winters, whose computer I had used. And I hadn’t learned anything. Well, I had learned one thing. The sinister department was located in building E, floor 7. The under construction floor.</p>
<p>What was I to do? Come back the next day and act like nothing had happened? No. I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t be able to put what had happened out of my mind. At least—I suddenly had a terrible thought. I had asked Leo Winters for access to his office. What if he talked? The Internal Department of Supervision could come after me. And who knows what they would do to me. For my nosing around, I figured I would be lucky to come out of the situation like Lora did, banished from the company, its premises, and its employees, under the threat of police force. So going back tomorrow was out of the question. Too risky. But then, they would definitely know that it was me.</p>
<p>I briefly entertained the thought of leaving town, changing my name, and leaving all this far behind me. But then I thought of Lora. After all, her targeting by the Internal Department of Supervision was what had gotten me into this situation. I couldn’t just abscond without trying to find her, find out what had happened to her. No. I would stay here, find out what happened to her and why, and help her if she needed any help. Although she could probably help me, actually, I realized, with the knowledge she must’ve gotten about the Internal Department of Supervision. Yet more reason to seek her out.</p>
<p>But now I had to figure out how exactly to do that. I figured that I would start with the one piece of information I did have: building E, floor 7. I could go over there and investigate it—probably best of all late on Friday, when most people would have left early for the weekend.</p>
<p>I called in sick the next two days, and so found myself standing in front of building E that Friday evening. Luckily, while the security was still there, their minds had evidently left work early just like the rest of the employees had physically done. They didn’t even bother to check my badge as I walked into the building. All I got were a few lazy surprised glances from them, presumably at the sight of someone walking into the office on a Friday evening, not out of it.</p>
<p>I crossed the empty lobby and entered the elevator, preparing to punch in floor 7. It wasn’t on the elevator panel. I stared at the panel for a few seconds, before deciding to go to floor 6. Maybe I could find something there.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I did find something—not the Internal Department of Supervision, but a staircase. Hidden behind several doors marked “Authorized Personnel Only”, there was a staircase leading upwards—presumably to the seventh floor. I tentatively ascended the stairs.</p>
<p>As I peered past the corner of the top of the stairs, I saw a shocking sight—although not an entirely unexpected one. The seventh floor of building E, supposedly under construction, was full of sleek offices. Unfortunately, contrary to my hopes, and my knowledge of the habits of my fellow employees, the place was swarming with people who I presumed worked for the Internal Department of Supervision. They wore the same inky black outfits of the shadowy figures who had apprehended Leo Winters. I hesitated. What was I going to do now? I hadn’t really thought out a gameplan of what I would do once I arrived at the place, much less a plan of what to do with all these people around.</p>
<p>But before I had time to mull over this fact, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs behind me. I whirled around to face an employee of the Internal Department of Supervision. As he saw me, a disquieting smile came over his face.</p>
<p>“Ah, hello, employee Kline. Or rather, should I say former employee Kline.” his grin widened.</p>
<p>“Who are you? How do you know me?” I asked, shocked. I had never seen that man in my life.</p>
<p>“Oh, we have our ways. Now come with me.”</p>
<p>“What—what for? And why do you say former employee Kline?”</p>
<p>“You should know why,” he replied.</p>
<p>“It’s Lora, isn’t it.”</p>
<p>The man just kept smiling his sickly smile.</p>
<p>“Why did you suspend her? Under the threat of police force? What did she do? She never did anything wrong! And now, I will face the same fate for just trying to sort this out? Why are you doing this? We’re just honest employees, trying to make a living through the advertising business!” I blew up.</p>
<p>The smile dropped like a stone from the man’s face. “You question the directives of the Internal Department of Supervision?” he asked menacingly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do! You’d better correct this grievous error with Lora! You have no right to do this!”</p>
<p>“Former employee Sanders was a significant malefactor. The Internal Department of Supervision acted in the best interests of the company in suspending her.”</p>
<p>“But what did she actually do?”</p>
<p>“Former employee Kline, you will come with me right away,” he said coldly. “You will face the judgment of the Directors. I would advise you stop asking stupid questions if you want to avoid the extremest of punishments.”</p>
<p>I saw that I had nothing to lose. I lunged at the Internal Department of Supervision employee, throwing him down the flight of stairs along with myself. He lessened my fall, and I was able to get up from the floor. I tore out through the doors that had led me to the staircase, my mind racing. I shouldn’t take the elevator—they probably could stop it. I took the stairs down, hurrying to escape the pounding feet I heard behind me. I had just reached the second floor when a terrible thought struck me. The security guards at the building—they hadn’t been normal security guards. They had informed the Internal Department of Supervision that I had arrived here. How else would they have caught me on that staircase?</p>
<p>I hurriedly glanced around as I heard footsteps thundering up the stairs below me. They had me cornered. They would catch me, and subject me to who-knows-what terrible punishment. All because I had been concerned about their harsh and unwarranted suspension of a good employee, and, I imagined, a good friend of mine too. The unjustness of the situation struck me hard. She had done nothing wrong, and had been arbitrarily punished. And now, I was going to be too, for nothing wrong either. So this was how it would all come to an end. I had fallen into the trap, and the hunters were closing in on me.</p>
<p>But then I noticed the small pool beneath the window in front of me. A way out. I looked to my left, and saw the Internal Department of Supervision agents charging down the stairs towards me. I saw some more storming up towards me from the first floor. No time for hesitation. I jumped.</p>
<p>Time stopped as the glass window shattered under the force of my jump. I saw the staggered faces of the Internal Department of Supervision agents as I threw myself out of the window. The glass shards streamed past my face as I hovered two stories above the ground. I saw Lora’s face in front of me. I tried to make out her expression. Was she pleased? Dismayed? Disappointed? Something else? I couldn’t tell. And then I fell like a boulder. The pool broke my fall, but I still felt the weight of a billion advertisement scripts slamming into my legs before I blacked out.</p>
