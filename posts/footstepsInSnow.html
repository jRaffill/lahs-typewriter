			<p> My feet ache and my hands shiver slightly as I tug on my mom’s hand to bring her attention to a swirling snow globe. I’ve been watching the currents within it for the past few minutes and I’m entranced. Beneath the thick veil of white flakes my eyes trace the shape of a museum, and the silver calligraphy beneath that spells out, <em>“MET.”</em> I love the way the sparkles catch briefly in the dull gift shop light, swirling around the miniature building within. But my mother doesn’t seem to see the same. She gives me a stern look and turns back to the wall of souvenir magnets, examining each of them even though they all seem identical: the Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State Building, and “Welcome to New York” assaulting my eyes in big blocky font. None of them are magical the way this one is. I try to tear my gaze away from it as my mother gives up and turns to leave the gift shop, but I can’t resist one last look before dejectedly leaving the room and entering the main lobby. </p>
			<p> Immediately I’m cast adrift. I’m drowning in a sea of adults with long legs who take three steps for every one of mine. I try to stay in control but instead I’m pushed along like a little flower petal in a heavy current, tossing and turning in a froth. The corners of the room seem to retreat as I look at each of them in turn, and the ceiling above feels less like a sleek, modern gray and more like the color of storm clouds. Despite the mass of people, I’m cold all over, from my toes in my thick woolen socks all the way through my fingers in my sparkly purple gloves. I stop for a moment, reaching for my mom’s arm, but instead, my hand collides with the arm of a stranger; they favor me with a brief look of annoyance before continuing to push through the crowd. I glance around but my parent’s faces are nowhere in sight. I’m alone. </p>
			<p> As soon as the realization sinks into my stomach, I jump into action, my feet seemingly moving of their own accord. As I near the exit to the museum, the crowd thins out and I shrink into my bright yellow jacket, sticking my hands into my pockets. The smaller crowd should come as a comfort to my frayed nerves, but it’s the opposite: narrowing my gaze on each individual face, my heartbeat accelerates as I confirm they aren’t my parents. Passing the checked-in bags and the security guards, panic begins to rise in my throat and flutter in circles around my chest. The cold, clammy air of the building makes me feel slightly claustrophobic, and the feeling persists even as I trail out of the huge doors onto the vast steps beyond. </p>
			<p> The snow, falling lightly from the sky, is gray and ugly. It’s nighttime, but the stars have been replaced by the bright halos of streetlights, turning the sky a dark, foreboding gray. I strain my eyes to try to catch sight of my parents but I don’t see them. <em>Didn’t they wait for me?</em> The thought forms an insistent pressure in the back of my head, demanding to be heard again and again but slipping out of my grasp each time I try to confront it. Each step I take feels smaller than the last, especially when I look up at the endless expanse of black asphalt before me. The ground is slick with muddy ice and sleet, half-melted and running together, and my foot catches, nearly causing me to trip. I think back to the warm light in the gift shop, the feeling of my mom’s hand in mine, and the clean crisp snow in the globe. My head begins to ache and my willpower is rapidly crumbling away, as pain begins to manifest in my eyes, my hands, my face. Even my ears begin to sting from the biting wind, and I remember the hat my mom made me bring. I made her carry it around the whole trip; it’s probably still tucked under her arm, wherever she is. I should have worn it. The thought of her walking with it, away from me, only makes my headache worse, and finally tears start to slide quietly down my face. I try to comfort myself by imagining how I’ll recognize my parents by their brightly colored coats. How they’ll be waiting by the side of the road, searching the crowd for me. They’ll see me, and wave at me, and I’ll run over and they’ll hug me and my feet will stop hurting and my face will be warm, buried in their jackets. <em>They haven’t forgotten about me,</em> I tell myself. <em>How could they have forgotten about me?</em> But rather than speeding up, my footsteps slow as the snow thickens, surrounding me in a cold and hazy embrace. </p>
			<p> I’m shivering again by the time I reach the crossing, which stretches out into the darkness, the other side nearly impossible to see. My hand twitches instinctively before I remember that there’s nobody whose hand I can hold to cross. I’m stranded here, on one side of an impossible chasm, with my parents just out of reach. I watch as the light to cross turns on and a small crowd bustles across the street. They look so warm, so unconcerned. The light turns off and cars begin to rush past, their headlights forming streaks in the air. </p>
			<p> My knees suddenly feel weak and I sit down onto a small hill of snow. My body sinks into it. I wish it would envelop me completely, give a physical manifestation of the gaping sinkhole within me, swallowing all thought and emotion until all that’s left is despair. I take a deep breath, and another, but it’s as futile as tightening my grip on the edge of a crumbling cliff, trying to ignore the sinking feeling in my stomach, to force my eyes away from the inevitable drop. </p>
			<p> I look up to see someone standing over me. The anguish in my gaze must give the answer to her question. </p>
			<p> “...Not really,” I admit. The grainy snow beneath my palms has begun to make them feel numb. </p>
			<p>“Where are your parents?”</p>
			<p>“I… don’t know,” I whisper, shrinking further away from the tall and imposing stranger. Each breath of cold air feels like a struggle, and my words feel sluggish as though they’re trying and failing to keep up with my thoughts. “I think – we were leaving and – and they weren’t there anymore. I don’t know where they went.”</p>
			<p>“Do you remember where you saw them last?”</p>
			<p>I think back to the dim gift shop with the low ceiling. “In the museum,” I say. “We were looking at magnets.”</p>
			<p>“And do you remember where they went?”</p>
			<p>“We were all leaving the gift shop and…” Now that I think about it, I don’t remember seeing them after stepping through the threshold into the lobby. I press my hands further down until I can’t feel where the snow ends and I begin. “I got lost.”</p>
			<p>“You haven’t seen them since the gift shop?” She sets her shoulders. “I’ll walk with you back to the museum and we can ask if anyone saw where they were going.”</p>
			<p>I sniffle and wipe my eyes, then hop off my little hill of snow and begin to trot back to the museum with her. The walk back feels much shorter even though my feet are dragging; it feels like I’m pulling against some sort of thread that connects me with my parents, stretching tightly between us, about to snap forever. </p>
			<p> Walking back to the monumental staircase, I’m cold and miserable and ashamed. <em>Why didn’t I walk faster? Why wasn’t I able to catch up to them?</p>
			<p> Why didn’t they wait for me?</p> </em>
			<p> Finally, we reach the doors of the MET. Stepping through, I’m met with the echoing sound of what seems like thousands of footsteps, matching my growing headache. Each moment feels like a brushstroke in an impressionist painting, seemingly distinct yet impossible to separate from each other, leaving no hard edges, only a blurry sense of loss. I feel as though I’m floating through these moments, grasping at each one just as it drifts out of reach; if I tried a little bit harder, I could pluck one out of the air and cling onto it, and for that impossible moment, all the feelings melting together inside of me could return to being dots of color on a canvas, glittering white snowflakes instead of a muddy mess of sleet, all running together into a dull throb of fear and despair. </p>
			<p> I’m dimly aware of the woman guiding me to a security guard, but I can’t hear a word she says. Numbness spreads through me, as though in my mind I’m still sitting on the hill of snow, slowly being enveloped. It’s strange how distant I feel, observing the series of moments from afar, as though they were encapsulated in an upside-down fishbowl of a glass cover and I was watching a distorted image of the blizzard swirling within, my eyes aching from trying to catch an individual flake of snow.</p>
			<p> I still feel like I’m floating through time and space when I finally notice my parents, slightly separated from the crowd, set aside by the universe just for me. My feet glide across the ground as I run over to them, but even as my body races across the ground, as my view narrows in on my sister’s face, a part of my mind is still trailing behind, pulled along like a balloon by an overexcited child. It’s only when I grip onto my mother’s arm, tears still streaming down my face, that I can find a path of footprints leading out of the snowstorm and back into reality. It’s only when I press against my father’s chest that I can find shape and form among the formless blur of individually colored moments. It’s only when my sister envelops me in a hug that warmth and feeling returns to my hands. </p>
			<p> Leaving the MET that night, I listen to my parents berate me for leaving the building before they were ready, for walking for so long, and for making all the wrong choices, and I know they’re right. But at the same time my head feels ridiculously light, and the street looks like it’s painted in a million different shades of radiant color as I stomp through piles of snow. My dad holds my hand to cross the dark void of a crosswalk together, and I skip along the striped white and black lines, trying to jump across each one in a single step even though I’m too small to succeed. And finally, moments are no longer muddy dots or melted snowflakes. Each moment is like a stripe across the street, useful not only for the result but also for the joy of crossing it, together. </p>
