		<p>Floating like a soap bubble in the wide expanse of the endless blue field of sky, the small airship lay still. The golden late-afternoon light flooded the deck, spilling onto the wind-grazed balcony. Past that warm glow that bathed the floor, in the dim interior of the ship barely touched by the waning light of the day, the captain sat regarding the timeworn papers spread out on his desk. The four manuscripts which were the key to the airship’s long travels he had masterminded.</p>
		<p>He looked up from the writings to see, beyond the tiny stars that twinkled by the door as the dust briefly caught the brilliance of the sun, past the sea of blue in which the airship was suspended, the faraway sand dune. Deep within the depths of that remote ridge, hazy through the flickering of heat rising from the desert floor, would be the object of his dreams, what he had been ceaselessly searching for even before the beginning of the long trek the airship had embarked upon. Sedately getting up, he strode towards the balcony. The blades of the airship’s engines revolved lazily in the still air, unpowered, in the periphery of his vision as he stared out towards his destiny. After taking time to soak in the picturesque landscape that stretched out below him, readying for what was to come in little time, he went out to seek his one crewmate. It was time to land the airship.</p>
		<p>Near the foot of the lofty dune, where a sheltered oasis stood, the airship began its landing. Beside the small, warm lake, surrounded by a desert-verdant smattering of flora, the airship hovered mere feet above the ground. A line from the airship was thrown and fastened around a weathered bark of a nearby palm tree. From the cabin descended the two explorers into the balmy environs of the oasis, some dust still billowing around them from the airship’s engines. Wasting no time getting to business, they immediately marched out to the top of the dune, hauling their shovels as the harsh rays of the sun beat down on them from the sky.</p>
		<p>By the crest of the ridge, the tip of a boulder protruded from underneath the shifting sands. The explorers lay down their shovels next to the boulder.</p>
		<p>“Well, we’ve made it finally,” the captain commented to the airship’s engineer.</p>
		<p>“I can’t believe it's almost over myself,” she replied.</p>
		<p>They sat shielded from the torrid heat of the sun under the shred of shade the boulder afforded them, looking over the unbroken plain of gold that stretched out before them past the horizon in all directions, recuperating from their exertions, before they were ready for the final act. Under the base of the boulder, they began excavating a cavern. This was it. What they had spent years journeying around the world for. The captain could feel it, how close he was to the end. He knew it might take a few more days, but they would reach it in little time. Their expedition was nearly over.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>I was sitting in some run-down tavern, absent-mindedly staring at my half-empty glass, listening to the lone guitar playing in the background, when she walked in. I was sitting near the back end of the room, when, on the other side of the room, across the gulf of empty tables, Iris entered and took a table near the door.</p>
		<p>Upon seeing her, I was taken back all those years, back to the bygone age of airships. That fateful expedition I had brought her along on. I thought of those days of yesteryear, the thrill of exploration, every day approaching the final, greatest of all, discovery. I remembered how I thought it’d go. The exhilaration of digging towards the destination under the warm desert air, the heart-stopping moment when we would break into the dark tunnel under the sand, lined with ancient stone walls replete with arcane inscriptions, and finally, the sublime sight of the grandiose obelisks of the lost city sprawling out in front of us in the cool and dark heart of the dune. I imagined staring up at those immemorial monuments to the ambition of humanity, now gone from sight and knowledge for thousands of years past, preserved only under countless tons of sand. That chill down my spine I would feel as I looked up at those long-buried monoliths in awe. But that wasn’t how it went. We sweated under the merciless sun for weeks on end by that terrible, titanic, sand dune. And all we found was sand, sand, and more sand. No matter how much we tried to rid ourselves of it, it kept popping up everywhere. It got in our clothes. It got in our food. It got into the engines of the airship. It drove us crazy. We tried everything, looking for a different boulder sticking out of the dune, anything, that might have marked where we needed to dig. But we found nothing. It was my mistake, I suppose, for trusting those manuscripts that had fictional stories written out on their other sides. Yet the parts of them with useful instructions on them had led us far, the first leading to the second, the second leading us to the third, the third leading us to the fourth. Yet the fourth let us down. It did not lead us to the lost city it promised to lead us to.</p>
		<p>I gave up flying airships after that expedition. It had been a dying profession by that time anyway. By now, I barely even thought of it anymore. But Iris brought me back to those august days. Even in its twilight, the age of airships was radiant. And I had been part of it. Yet those years were now long over. It was midnight now. Why had she come in here? Even as much as I wanted to relive those days, I didn’t want to recall that lost yesteryear. All I could think of was how I could never return to that greatness, those salad days of exploration in my little airship. I longed for nothing more than to go back, to press on with those idyllic adventures before it was too late, before it was all gone. But I couldn’t. I wanted to curse her for coming in here, for bringing back all those memories. But she hadn’t brought about the end. She hadn’t failed me. I had failed her. I had promised her so much on that voyage, and she had done so much for me. But after all that work she had put in, the result was nothing. I had trusted the wrong manuscripts. Or interpreted the last one incorrectly, although even after the failure of the expedition, I tried in vain to salvage it, re-interpreting the fourth document’s instructions but to no avail. Regardless of what exactly went wrong, I was the one who had failed her.</p>
		<p>So there I was, stuck between wanting to go over to Iris and express my regrets for the expedition, how I had failed her, but how grateful I was for her help nevertheless, and wanting to put her out of my mind and never think of what was lost again. I looked up multiple times at her, wondering if she remembered me, if she would come over to me and bring up that odyssey, but she didn’t come over to me. I wondered what she thought of the whole ordeal we had gone through years ago, whether the sight of me after so long brought back all those emotions and memories as it had for me. I wanted to go over to her and ask her about it, but I couldn’t. The rows of empty tables between us was like a limitless ocean, separating us from ever reaching each other. I couldn’t bring myself to get up and walk over to her. And so I stayed sitting in my chair at the other end of the tavern, half of the time pretending to not see her, half of the time trying to see if she was looking at me.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Rushing through the dingy marketplace, pushing past people in the claustrophobic walkways, he hurriedly scanned the booths for the place he was looking for. He felt his thoughts being drowned in the ocean of noise of vendors advertising their wares, customers haggling over prices, and arguments between rival sellers surrounding him. He didn’t know where the small shop he was looking for was located, and he was running out of time. Only about an hour left until they would close, as he was told.</p>
		<p>He elbowed his way past some particularly slow people, ignoring their angry shouts of protestation as he kept on forward. The place had to be somewhere here. He had come to a dead end. The walkway ended in a stand selling spices from some far-flung corner of the world. Not what he was looking for. Desperately, he turned and darted through a nearby stall selling fabrics, pushing through the silks and rugs hanging from the ceiling of the booth, trying to cut into the walkway on the other side of it.</p>
		<p>He quickly parted the rainbow of cloth in front of him and saw a tent. Another booth? He hadn’t passed through the other walkway. What was one stall doing inside another? He tried to clear his mind from the muffled pandemonium outside. Then a thought struck him. Was this the place?</p>
		<p>He walked up to a woman he saw standing near the entrance of the tent.</p>
		<p>“Excuse me, is this __ Manuscripts?” he asked.</p>
		<p>“Yes, it is,” she replied.</p>
		<p>“You run the place?”</p>
		<p>“No. The proprietor is away right now, so I’m just waiting here.”</p>
		<p>“What’re you looking for here?”</p>
		<p>“Oh, nothing in particular. I’m just fascinated by ancient scripts like these,” she said, gesturing towards the tent. “And who knows? I might find something valuable. What about you?”</p>
		<p>The man hesitated. “Well... you won’t tell anyone?”</p>
		<p>“Sure,” she replied amusedly.</p>
		<p>“Well, I happen to be looking for a manuscript that tells of the location of a long-lost city.” he said after another moment’s hesitation.</p>
		<p>“Really? Sounds interesting.”</p>
		<p>“Yeah. And I intend to find it.”</p>
		<p>“Now, how would you have happened to have heard of something like that?”</p>
		<p>“It... it was on an unrelated airship expedition I was on. I stumbled upon this old man that told me of a rumor of a lost city... I was, of course, intrigued. One thing led to another, and now I’m here.”</p>
		<p>“You’ve traveled on an airship?”</p>
		<p>“Captain, in fact. Not that it was a large airship, though. Only had one crewmate.”</p>
		<p>“You know, I worked on an airship once. I was the engineer’s assistant.”</p>
		<p>“But not anymore?”</p>
		<p>“I wanted to see the world. But I’d chosen a passenger airship. Not one on an expedition, like you’re captain of. Not only were there only two locations I would ever be able to visit, there wasn’t much time to visit them anyway before we had to take off again. I quit.”</p>
		<p>“I see. How was the work?”</p>
		<p>“Oh, it wasn’t that hard. I performed well enough. Actually pretty well, in fact. They were sad to see me go.”</p>
		<p>The man contemplated this for a second. “Say, would you like to go on the expedition to the lost city with me? I haven’t been able to find an engineer. Well, provided I find the manuscript in the first place, of course.”</p>
		<p>She grinned slightly. “Yeah, I would be interested.”</p>
		<p>“I’m Samuel, by the way.” the man said.</p>
		<p>“I’m Iris.” the woman said. “Glad I’ll be able to go on your expedition.”</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>I had just walked into some run-down tavern when I noticed him. I had been passing through the area and entered the tavern for a quick bite to eat, when, on the other side of the room, across the expanse of empty tables, I saw Samuel sitting by himself at a table.</p>
		<p>Seeing him took me back all those years to the ill-fated expedition. I still remembered how we had gone so far, but just at the end, we tripped at the goal post. The expedition failed. He was devastated. I had been extremely disappointed too, not being able to see the great lost city that Samuel and the manuscripts had attested to. But he seemed to have taken it much harder than me. On the brief return trip from the desert, he barely said a word to me, and locked himself up in his cabin whenever he could. He even gave me his airship and the manuscripts after we arrived, muttering that he didn’t want to have anything to do with airships or exploration anymore. In that sense, the expedition had been partly successful for me. I had gained an airship out of it. But just as the airships gained a new captain, they had lost one. And the lost city remained still lost to the sands of time, still unseen by human eyes after those thousands of years. It hadn’t felt like a success for me.</p>
		<p>I wondered how he was holding up. If he had gotten back flying airships, though not many did anymore by then. I wondered if he remembered me and the expedition. If he still wanted, deep within his mind, to go back on the journey for that elusive city. I certainly wanted to. And I could. But for some reason, I didn’t feel that way.</p>
		<p>I tried to see if Samuel would come over to talk to me, but I only saw him occasionally looking in my direction, often quickly averting his gaze. Why, I fretted. Had he truly forgotten me? I felt as if he couldn’t have forgotten that whole expedition, with all the work we had put into it, and the dispiritingly anticlimactic end. Had he truly put airships and exploration completely out his mind? Just when the pursuit needed people like him, who had years of experience, of ambition, to resuscitate it from the doldrums of irrelevancy, had he resolved to never even think of anything related to it ever again? Or worse, did he remember me, but resent me for the failure of the expedition? That terrible thought entered my mind. Had I failed him? Back then, I hadn’t thought that. We had simply read the manuscripts the wrong way, missed the clues between the lines. But now he wouldn’t even look towards me for more than a few passing seconds. What had I done? I had thought I had done my part well in the expedition. Why did he dislike me now? I racked my brains, trying to find something, however small, in which I had failed. I came up blank. But surely he wouldn’t do this to me without a reason. There had to be something. Why did he constantly look so dismissively away seconds after looking in my direction? What had I done?</p>
		<p>I couldn’t take it anymore. I took a deep breath, and walked through the gap of tables seperating us up to him. “Samuel?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“Oh, hello, Iris.” he said with a pained smile.</p>
		<p>So he did remember me. And he didn’t like me anymore. I started heading back towards the exit of the tavern.</p>
		<p>“Wait!” he cried out. “Come back!”</p>
		<p>Wait? What for? For him to criticize me for things I hadn’t even done wrong? To just hurt me more than he already had? I turned around slowly. I hesitated. But something about the look on his face convinced me, albeit barely, to go back and listen to what he wanted to say to me.</p>
		<p>“Yes?”</p>
		<p>“I—I—” he looked away from me. “I just wanted to say that I’m sorry.”</p>
		<p>That shocked me. It was the complete opposite of what I thought he’d say. “What for?”</p>
		<p>“For failing you in that expedition all those years back. I was the captain. I was responsible for the whole thing. And I messed it up. I don’t know... just trusting those manuscripts, with their—their random stories on the back, and... I failed you. I promised we’d find the city, but—” he broke off.</p>
		<p>“No. No, you have nothing to apologize for—” I started.</p>
		<p>“Don’t try to take the blame or anything. I failed you. Not the other way around.” he sighed. “If only we had found it. Think of how great that would’ve been...” he said pensively.</p>
		<p>“You’re... still interested in trying to find it?” I probed.</p>
		<p>“No!” he replied.</p>
		<p>“Yes!” he followed up before I could say anything.</p>
		<p>“I don’t know.” he ended with.</p>
		<p>“You don’t know?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“I... I don’t know. I still would like to find it, but... but what can we do? We didn’t find it. And how do we go about finding it now? There are no other manuscripts. And the instructions on that fourth document—I looked over it again and again. There was nowhere else the city could be. We have nothing to follow. We’d might as well... throw darts blindfolded at a world map.”</p>
		<p>“Well, actually...” I began. Because I could’ve begun the search for the lost city again. Because I had an idea.</p>
		<p>“Those stories that each manuscript had on the other end? They could be the real directions to the city.”</p>
		<p>“What?” Samuel looked up in surprise.</p>
		<p>“You’ve got to read between the lines, see.” I began to explain. “You know how the short story on the fourth manuscript keeps on mentioning this number—4132?”</p>
		<p>“It did?”</p>
		<p>“Yes. Now, in looking over that story, I really wondered about that number. And eventually, I thought—what if the digits in the number corresponded to the manuscripts?”</p>
		<p>“Why—why would they?”</p>
		<p>“Well, I'm not sure, just taking that story into account. But it fits with a theory I’ve developed about the manuscripts. A theory which could lead us to the lost city.”</p>
		<p>Samuel nodded and I felt I could see a slight interest in his eyes.</p>
		<p>“So the fourth story, for the digit four in the number, provides the number itself. I think the four at the start of the number is just confirmation that you’re starting to look in the right place. Then, I looked at the first manuscript. And I think that it confirms the concept that there is a path to the lost city—do you remember how at the end of that first story, it's briefly mentioned that the main character thinks about wanting to go on an expedition, find lost ancient ruins?”</p>
		<p>“I mean, that was a bit interesting, considering what the manuscripts were supposed to lead us to...” he mused.</p>
		<p>I continued onwards. “Now the story of the third manuscript. That, I think, confirms to the reader that they’re on the right path, and also tells them how to decipher the real location of the lost city, which the number 4132 would indicate would be in the second story. And do you remember the story of the third manuscript?”</p>
		<p>“I’m not sure…”</p>
		<p>“Well, in it, the detective goes through a set of four documents to unscramble the identity of some murderer. Sound familiar? It even uses the same trick in which one of the documents contains a number which tells the detective in which order to look through the documents. And in the final document he looks at, the identity of the murderer is revealed through the name of a character that is mentioned but never seen, as the character’s name is similar to the name of the murderer.”</p>
		<p>Samuel leaned forward in his chair with more interest.</p>
		<p>“And so, I looked at the second manuscript. In its story, a character, Lallan, is mentioned repeatedly, but the narrator never ends up meeting them during the events recounted in the story.”</p>
		<p>“Lallan? Now what place would that be?” Samuel wondered out loud. “Lallan, Lallan... wait! Lurlan?”</p>
		<p>“That’s the conclusion I arrived at.” I replied.</p>
		<p>“It says the lost city is located in Lurlan?”</p>
		<p>“I think so.”</p>
		<p>“Well, it's just a theory...” he contemplated.</p>
		<p>“But it is something concrete. Better than just guessing randomly.”</p>
		<p>“I guess so...”</p>
		<p>“Now, I happen to be the captain of an airship. And all I’m looking for is someone to be the engineer. Would you like to go on the expedition with me?”</p>
		<p>Samuel thought this over. I looked expectantly at him. I probably could’ve found some other engineer after some time of looking, but I realized why I hadn’t. After all, finding the city had been Samuel’s passion. And I was sure he’d love to go on another expedition to find it. Because I was sure that this time, we would find it. I awaited his answer.</p>
		<p>“Yeah, I would be interested.”</p>
